I got asked a git question the other day and thought I should blog my reply.

>Is it safe to run this? ``git branch -f master origin/master``

To which I replied: Yes, with a but.

##The But?
Any local commits you have may be orphaned.

##Why?
What you need to know about that command is that if (and let's assume it does) the branch "master" exists, then 
the ``-f`` switch will mean that the local branch gets reset to the remote branch, thus removing any local commits.

See the Options section under Branching in the manual, <http://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch>, for more.

##Let's see what I mean

-- example..

##How do you get them back?

```
git fsck --lost-found
```

Once you ascertain which commits to reapply, simply merge that commit:

```
git merge <SHA1>
```

Done!
